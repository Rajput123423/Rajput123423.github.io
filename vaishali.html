            <P>
                Vaishali find its origin way back in history from the Mahabharata period. It is the place where democracy found its origin around 600BC. Numerous references to Vaishali are found in texts pertaining to both Jainism and Buddhism, which have preserved much
                information on Vaishali and the other Maha Janapadas. Based on the information found in these texts, Vaishali was established as a republic by the 6th century BC, prior to the birth of Gautama Buddha in 563, making it the world’s first
                republic. Being the birthplace of the last Jain “Thirthankara” Lord Mahavir gives Vaishali a very special place in history.The founder of Buddhism, Gautam Buddha delivered his last sermon and announced his Parinirvana (attainment of enlightment)
                on this holy soil. It is also renowned as the land of Ambapali (Amrapali), the great Indian courtesan. It is held that the district derives its name from King Vishal. However, history records that around the time Patliputra was the centre
                of political, cultural and economic activities in the Gangetic plains, Vaishali came into existence as centre of the Ganga, it was the seat of the Republic of Vajji.

            <P>
                King Ashoka became a great follower of Buddhism after the massacre of Kalinga and erected his one his famous Ashokan pillar in Vaishali which was to memorialize the last sermon of Lord Buddha that took place here. There is a life like figure of a lion
                flawlessly engraved, at the top of the pillar facing north, believed to be the direction of Lord Buddha's last voyage. There is a brick stupa and a pond known as Ramkund next to the pole which sums up to make a sanctified spot for Buddhists.
                There is also a small tank here known as Ramkund.

            <P>
                A 125ft, tall peace pagoda which was built by the Buddh Vihar society in collaboration with Japanese government was excavated in 1969. It is a really huge, white, beautiful stupa surrounded by enormous greenery, serenity and a pond where you can spend
                some leisure time boating and breathing in the fresh air. Just next to Vishwa Shanti Stupa is Abhishek Pushkarni known as coronation tank and the sacred waters of this tank were used for anointing the elected representatives before their
                pledge, at the time of Lichchavis. And as you amble around you will find a museum on the north bank which houses the artifacts found during excavation, dividing them into four galleries, one is terracotta items of Human figures, another
                gallery has terracotta items of animal figures with wheels, cast coins etc. The third gallery exhibits antles, bones and iron and copper commodities. And the fourth gallery houses earthen wares.

            <P>
                There are two Stupas, Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 which are named on the basis of their discovery and excavation. Both of them have the ashes of Lord Buddha (which were divided into eight parts) preserved in stone caskets. Both the Stupas are now in a dilapidated
                condition, however, still have a great reverence in Buddhism.
