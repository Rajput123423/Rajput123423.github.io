                Siwan district, situated in the western part of the state, was originally a sub-division of Saran district, which in ancient times formed a part of Kosala Kingdom.[4] Siwan became a fully-fledged district when it was split from Saran in 1976.[5] Don,
                a village in the area, has the ruins of a fort believed to be that of Drona, and contains a stupa that contained the vase of Buddha's ashes. A recently excavated marvelous statue of Lord Vishnu at Bherbania village from underneath a tree
                indicates that there were large numbers of followers of Lord Vishnu.
