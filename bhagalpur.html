            <h1 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT BHAGALPUR</h1>
            The district of Bhagalpur is situated in the central part of Bhagalpur division. The city of Bhagalpur is the headquarters of Bhagalpur division as also of the district and Sadar subdivision. There are 3 sub-divisions viz., Naugachia, Bhagalpur Sadar
            and Kahalgaon in the district. Number of C.D. Blocks in the district is 16. There are 1515 villages and 4 statutory towns in the district.The district of Bhagalpur, as presently constituted, comprised the south-eastern part of the Subah of
            Bihar in the Mughal times. When the Diwani of Bihar, Bengal and Orissa was granted to the East India Company in 1765, the district consisted of a large area east of Sarkar Munger and, with the exception of Pargana Chhai, lay entirely south
            of the Ganges. This also included Munger which was separated in 1832.Santhal Pargana was formed into a separate district in 1855-56.<BR/><BR/> The area of the district of the Ganges was thus greatly reduced. In the year 1954, the entire area north of
            the Ganges, with the exception of Bihpur, Naugachhia and Gopalpur Police Stations was constituted into the new Saharsa district.  This was an epoch of great material and cultural progress. With the decline of the Guptas, the Gaud King Sasanka gained control over the area in 602 A.D. and maintained his dominion till his
            death in 625 A.D. His death marked the decline of Gaud power and later the area came under Harsha’s domain of influence. <BR/><BR/>He installed Madhav Gupta as king of Magadh. His son Adityasena has left an inscription in Mandar Hill indicating the
            installation of Narsimha or Narhari temple by him.Hiuen Tsang visited Champa in the course of his travels. He has left a description of the town in his travel accounts.The Palas of Bengal came to power in 755 A.D. with the election of Gopala
            as the king. He conquered Bihar. Dharmapala succeeded him. Vigrahpala established his authority in Anga. A copper plate ascribed to his son Narayanpal has been found at Bhagalpur. Vikramshila, the seat of the famous University, was founded
            by Gopala. The Senas also ruled over Anga after the fall of the Palas.
