           <h1 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT KAIMUR</h1>
            Located in the Western Part of Bihar, Kaimur is one of the most beautiful places in Bihar. As Kaimur is a district, many places are located there, which many tourists love to explore. The headquarter of this exciting region is situated in Bhabua. Kaimur
            is a relatively larger administrative district with many educational institutions, hospitals, and government offices. Kaimur district is quite famous among archaeologists and historians. The main reason behind its popularity is that evidence
            of the earliest inhabitants’ residence can be seen over there. Rock paintings from more than 20,000 years ago can be seen in the caves of Lehda forest in Kaimur. The region was once a significant part of the Magadan empire, but now few people
            know about it. Moreover, different erotic sculptures presumably constructed by the Pala dynasty were excavated in Kaimur in 2012. There are many temples located there, which will help you understand its historical and mythological significance.
            Apart from all the important historical and spiritual sites, Kaimur’s natural beauty is quite breathtaking. As the entire district is divided into the plateaus and the hills, you will witness varying topological views over there.

                 <h1 style="text-align:center;">BAIDYANATH</h1>
            Baidyanath is a tiny village which is located quite close to the Ramgarh town of Kaimur district. Now, the reason why we include this village in this list is that the entire city has a great archaeological significance. While exploring the city, you will
            see a beautiful Shiva Temple. This temple was built by the Pratihar dynasty but was excavated much later. That is why many different artifacts, coins, or other items have been found in the village’s soil. You will love this village if you
            are a lover of archaeological findings and excavation.

             <h1 style="text-align:center;">KARMANASA RIVER</h1>
            One of the lesser-known tributaries of the Ganges, the Karmanasa River, is one of the most beautiful rivers in Bihar. This river not only flows through the Kaimur district of Bihar but also flows through Uttar Pradesh. The name “Karmanasa” roughly translates
            to “The destroyer of religious merits.” There is a unique reason for the terminology of the river. It is believed that when sage Vishvamitra decided to create a new universe, he created a person named “Trishanku.” But while sending Trishanku
            to the new universe as its ruler, Indra stopped Vishvamitra in his creation. Trishanku was suspended mid-air, and from his saliva, the river Karmanasa was created. Even though this story is mythological, but it is quite intriguing to know.
            The river has its origin in the Kaimur range at an altitude of 1,150 feet. This river has a tributary in Kaimur named Durgavati, which you can visit while exploring the district.

                <h1 style="text-align:center;">RAMGARH</h1>
            Ramgarh is yet another village in Kaimur, which is breathtakingly beautiful. This village is famous among tourists because it is home to the sacred Maa Mundeshwari temple. As the temple is located at the height of 600-feet, the natural beauty from the
            top of the building is quite pretty. Many archeological artifacts have been found in the area surrounding the temple. Many people who are interested in history visit the village to know more about it.

           <h1 style="text-align:center;">BHAGWANPUR</h1>
            Located not that far away from Bhabua, Bhagwanpur is an exciting village located in the Kaimur district of Bihar. Many local people believe that this village was the seat of the Paras descendant Kumar Chandrasen Saran Singh. Later, the town was captured
            by Sher Shah, but the then king of Kaimur, Raja Shaliwahan, recaptured it during Akbar’s rule. If you explore the village for a day, you will get to know many historical facts from the local people. Even though some of the points might not
            be true, it is quite interesting to hear them from the people living there.

             <h1 style="text-align:center;">CHAINPUR</h1>
            Chainpur is one of the villages near Bhabua, which is quite significant to India’s medieval history. As the town has a mausoleum of Bakhtiar Khan, it is quite common to have some questions. The reason his mausoleum is over there is that he was the son-in-law
            of Sher Shah Suri. A fort is located in the village which was built during the time of Akbar. When you visit the fort, you will see a shrine of the famous Hindu priest named Harshu Brahm. He was one of the most important priests of Raja Shaliwahan
            during the Kanyalkubya dynasty. While exploring Kaimur, do not forget to explore Chainpur as well.
