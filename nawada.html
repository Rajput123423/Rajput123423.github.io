            <p>
                Nawada is a city and a municipality in Bihar, India. It is also the headquarters of the Nawada district. It is the headquarters of the subdivision of the same name, lying on both sides of the Khuri River( also known as Sakri river in some parts) at 24º
                53’ N and 85º 33’ E. The name evolved from Nau-abad, meaning the new town. Nawada is a part of the famous ancient Magadh division of south Bihar. The origin of the name Nawada is believed to be derived from the old Persian name Nau-abadah,
                which means "new town" which was earlier known as ‘The Eliot Market (Bazaar)’. Before its acquisition by the East India Company, Nawada was ruled by the nearly independent Rajas of Hisua. After its acquisition, Nawada was in great disorder
                until 1845, when it became the headquarters of the newly created subdivision. The elements of disorder resurfaced again during the Mutiny of 1857 when Nawada was overrun by marauding parties. The local offices were destroyed, but Government
                records were saved by the native officials who hid them in a cave on a neighbouring hill. These are the only available public records dating back to an era before 1857 in the district. Two miles to the north, there is a Jain temple standing
                in the middle of a large tank to the west of the public road, but the city itself contains no important buildings and has little historical interest.

            <P>

                the sheer beauty of Mother Nature cascading marvelously. The Kakolat waterfall of Bihar cascades down from a height of between 150 and 160 feet and forms a natural reservoir at the base of the waterfall. Good fall in Bihar Legends are
                also associated with the Kakolat waterfall such as a Treta Yug king was cursed to take the shape of a python and live at the falls here, by a Hindu spiritualist. The place was then visited by the Pandavas during their exile and it was
                during that time that the python king got rid of the curse, and he proclaimed that any person who bathed in the waterfall would never be reborn as a snake. Kakolat waterfall has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction in Bihar,
                where huge crowds can be seen during summers for weekend picnics. This waterfall also boats a wide variety of watersports and fun in the water. Apart from its significance as a tourist destination, the Kakolat waterfall is also widely
                visited at the time when a big fair is held on an occasion of bishua or chait Sankranti. This is basically a religious event accompanied by a three-day festival, where many devotees take their bath in the waterfall. The Kakolat waterfall
                has great historical and mythological significance. The waterfall is located near Govindpur police station, about 33 km away from Nawada, on Kakolat Hill. Below the falls there is a deep natural reservoir. The fall is approximately 160
                feet (49 m) in height. The scene is panoramic due to the all-round green forest area. Kakolat Fall is a popular tourist spot in Bihar. During the summer, people from all over India come to the falls for picnics.

            <P>
                Griddhakuta mountain is a place where Lord Buddha used to preach. It is a must see place if you are in Rajgir or Nawada. To Visit Griddhakuta Mountain you have to go to the Vishwa Shanti Stupa by ropeway and then you need to walk down a bit to take a
                diverted route. The way is almost same from where people walk to Vishwa Shanti Stupa it just has a diversion in between. While walking to the top you will find 3 caves. First one is of Rahula, second of Sariputta and third of Lord Buddha.
                It's a beautiful place but don't visit in the summer, that will be very tiring.
