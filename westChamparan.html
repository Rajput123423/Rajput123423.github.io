            <P>
                First Creation of Champarn District : 1866 On 2nd November 1972 Champaran district was split up Into two districts, viz. Purbi Champaran and Paschim Champaran. East Champaran is a part of Tirhut Division. The headquarter of Purbi Champaran district is
                at Motihari .Presently Purbi Champaran consists of Six Subdivisions and Twenty Seven Blocks. Nepal makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi and Sheohar eastern while Muzaffarpur South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side.
                The name Champaran owes its origin to Champa-aranya or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means Magnolia and aranya mess forest. Hence, Champaranya means Forest of Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. It is popularly believed that the nomenclature here
                was made while the vest forest part was inhabited by solitary ascetics. It is needless to say that has Purbi means Eastern Side.

            <P>
                The temple of Saint Vallabhacharya is divided into two parts; the Prakatya Baithakhji Mandir and Mool Prakatya, both of which are dedicated to Shri Vallabhacharya, the founder of Pushti Bhakti Marg. This is the temple where prayers are offered and ‘seva’
                is done. The temple has several silver doors with designs on them and vibrant colours inside the temple as well, with a rich history narrating how Shri Vallabh was born, where he was brought up and how he became instrumental in bringing
                the form of Lord Shrinathji out of the Govardhan Hill in Vraj; the same Shrinathji that now resides in a town called Nathdwara in Rajasthan. The shrine inside the temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and is adorned in silver and gold. Apart
                from regular seva that is performed here, there are many rituals and traditions that are held inside the temple for important festivals and Utsavs. This is a must see temple in the region.</div>
