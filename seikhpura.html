            <h1 style="text-align:center;">SHRI VISHNU TEMPLE</h1>
            <P>
                Located in the middle of a mighty pond, this temple now hosts the 2nd largest Idol of Lord Vishnu in the world. The idol was made of Black Granite during the Gupta period. A part of the Idol was always visible since many years on the banks of the same
                pond where this temple is now built in. But after mistaking it as a simple black stone for years, it was unearthed finally in 1992 to be found that it was the second largest Idol standing 7.5 feet high made in the historic times ( The
                largest one being the Idol of Lord Venkateshwara, standing 9 feet high, in the Balaji Temple, Tirupati, AP.) The people of the nearby villages of Saamas, Kutub Chak, etc. are religiously involved in making a great temple with the help
                of the State Govt and other agencies.
